<p> Summaries of the data and anonymous samples of comments obtained in this study may be included in a doctoral dissertation and in publications that arise from the research.</p>

<p> ??????????? In this study, we aim to acquire a better understanding of cultural differences when users take a cognitive test on a computer. You are being invited to participate in this study because you use a computer regularly at home and are free of cognitive and motor impairment to your hands. You can help us by using a computer application and providing feedback on your use experience. </p>
<p> ???????????? Your participation in this research study is entirely voluntary. This consent form, a copy of which can be printed here, is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should feel free to ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information. </p>
<p> ???????????? If you wish to participate, you will be invited to provide your consent but you should understand that you are free to withdraw your consent at any time and without giving any reasons for your decision. </p>

<h3>Who Is Conducting this Research? ???????????</h3>
<p> This research is conducted by a team of Investigators from UBC Computer Science and the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine. </p>

<h3>Purpose: </h3>
<p> The purpose of this research is to evaluate the usability of a new interface for customizing software applications, which allows users to change pre-defined settings. In particular, we are interested in comparing this new interface with the traditional settings panel found in the vast majority of applications. </p>

<h3>Procedure: </h3>
<p> This study is expected to require less than 30 minutes of your time. First, you will be asked to create a temporary account on Wunderlist.com, a popular todo list application, and to setup the experiment software by adding a bookmark to your web browser. Then you will be given a brief tutorial of how to use Wunderlist, and a set of tasks to complete using either Wunderlist's default settings panel or our new interface. When done with your tasks, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about the application.</p>

<h3>Objective: ??????????????</h3>
<p> The research objective is to inform and refine the design of a computerized program that is intended for cognitive health care purposes and is to be used by individuals with various cultural backgrounds. To achieve this, we need to first understand the effect of cultural differences -if any- on test performance and satisfaction with its computer interface. With this understanding we can continue to design effective and usable health care technologies which are culturally appropriate. </p>

<h3>What are the Possible Harms and Side Effects of Participating? </h3>
<p> There are no known risks to your participation in this study. </p>

<h3>What are the Benefits of Participating in this Research? </h3>
<p> There may be no immediate, direct benefit to you as a result of participating in this study. However the findings from this study can help us improve future health care technologies for use in domestic environments that may benefit you, your family members and the community in the longer term. </p>

<h3>What Happens If I Decide to Withdraw My Consent to Participate?</h3>
<p> Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time, and are not required to provide any reason for withdrawing. If you choose to enter the study and then decide to withdraw at a later time, all data collected about you during your enrollment in the study will be retained for analysis. By law, these data cannot be destroyed. If you wish to withdraw your consent, we ask that you notify Dr. Claudia Jacova at 604-822-7540 or Shathel Haddad at 604-773-8269. </p>

<h3>What Happens If Something Goes Wrong?</h3>
<p> Signing this consent form in no way limits your legal rights against the sponsor, investigators, or anyone else, and you do not release the study doctors or participating institutions from their legal and professional responsibilities. </p>

<h3>Will My Taking Part in this Study be Kept Confidential?</h3>
<p> Your confidentiality will be respected. However, research records and health or other source records identifying you may be inspected in the presence of the Investigator or his or her designate by representatives of the UBC Clinical Research Ethics Board for the purpose of monitoring the research. No information or records that disclose your identity will be published without your consent, nor will any information or records that disclose your identity be removed or released without your consent unless required by law.
   <br />
   <br /> You will be assigned a unique study number as a subject in this study. Only this number will be used on any research-related information collected about you during the course of this study, so that your identity [i.e. your name or any other information that could identify you] as a subject in this study will be kept confidential. Information that contains your identity will remain only with the Principal Investigator and/or designate. The list that matches your name to the unique study number that is used on your research-related information will not be removed or released without your consent unless required by law.
   <br />
   <br /> Your rights to privacy are legally protected by federal and provincial laws that require safeguards to insure that your privacy is respected and also give you the right of access to the information about you that has been provided to the sponsor and, if need be, an opportunity to correct any errors in this information. Further details about these laws are available on request to your study doctor. </p>

<h3>Who do I Contact if I have any Questions or Concerns about the Study?</h3>
