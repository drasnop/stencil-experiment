<h3>Study Purpose</h3>
<p>The goal of this study is to evaluate the usability of a new interface for customizing software applications, which allows users to change pre-defined settings. In particular, we are interested in comparing this new interface with the traditional settings panel found in many software applications.</p>

<h3>Study Procedures</h3>
<p>This study is expected to require less than 20 minutes of your time. First, you will be asked to create a temporary account on Wunderlist.com, a popular todo list application, and to setup the experiment software by adding a bookmark to your web browser. Then you will be given a brief tutorial on how to use Wunderlist, and a set of tasks to complete using either Wunderlist's default settings panel or our new interface. Finally you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about the application, as well as some demographic information.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
<p>We are very grateful for your participation in this study. You will receive a small honorarium ($1) for your participation, plus a bonus of up to $2 depending on your performance. </p>

<h3>Potential Risks</h3>

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
